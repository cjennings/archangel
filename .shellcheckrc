# shellcheck configuration for archangel
#
# Disabled checks:
# SC2034 - Variables assigned but appear unused (false positives from sourced files)
# SC2086 - Word splitting intended for command arguments ($pool_config, $SSH_OPTS)
# SC2162 - read without -r in fzf preview subshells (backslash processing is fine)
# SC2016 - Single quotes intentionally prevent expansion in echo'd scripts
# SC2317 - Functions appear unreachable but are called dynamically
# SC2012 - ls used for time-sorting (find alternative is more complex for no benefit)
# SC1091 - Can't follow sourced files (sourced at runtime)
# SC2329 - Functions not directly invoked (used by callers of sourced files)
# SC2011 - Use find instead of ls (same rationale as SC2012)
# SC2010 - Don't use ls | grep (intentional usage pattern)
# SC2129 - Consider { } >> file (stylistic, not a bug)
# SC2001 - Use ${var//} instead of sed (sed is clearer for complex patterns)
# SC2059 - Variables in printf format (intentional for hex conversion)
# SC2143 - Use grep -q (stylistic)
# SC2207 - Prefer mapfile (arrays from command output)
