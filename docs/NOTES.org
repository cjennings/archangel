** Welcome to Your First Session!

This is your first session with Craig on this project.

**First session checklist:**
1. **Determine project type and git/docs policy:**
   - Is this project in a git repository?
   - **Is this a code project** (Emacs package, library, software project)?
     - **YES (code project):** Add docs/ to .gitignore (private notes, not part of codebase)
       - Examples: org-msg, chime.el, wttrin, or any future Emacs packages/libraries
       - docs/ contains session notes and should remain private
     - **NO (non-code project):** Commit docs/ normally (part of the project documentation)
       - Examples: personal projects, business planning, documentation projects
       - docs/ is project documentation and should be versioned
   - What are the remote repositories (if any)?

2. **Understand the project:**
   - Ask what the project is about
   - Ask what the goals of the project are
   - Ask any clarifying questions along the way

3. **Brainstorm how to help:**
   - Discuss approaches and strategies
   - Identify immediate next steps

4. **Document learnings:**
   - Record what you learned in relevant sections of this document
   - Add project-specific context below this section

5. **Clean up:**
   - Remove this "Welcome to Your First Session!" heading and its content
   - Update Project-Specific Context section with actual project information

* AVAILABLE WORKFLOWS

This section lists all documented workflows for this project. Update this section whenever a new workflow is created.

** create-workflow
File: [[file:workflows/create-workflow.org][docs/workflows/create-workflow.org]]

Workflow:
1. Q&A discovery (4 core questions)
2. Assess completeness
3. Name the workflow
4. Document it
5. Update NOTES.org
6. Validate by execution

Created: [Date when workflow was created]

** create-v2mom
File: [[file:workflows/create-v2mom.org][docs/workflows/create-v2mom.org]]

Workflow for creating a V2MOM (Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, Metrics) strategic framework for any project or goal.

Workflow:
1. Understand V2MOM framework
2. Create document structure
3. Define Vision (aspirational picture of success)
4. Define Values (2-4 principles with concrete definitions)
5. Define Methods (4-7 approaches ordered by priority)
6. Identify Obstacles (honest personal/technical challenges)
7. Define Metrics (measurable outcomes)
8. Review and refine
9. Commit and use immediately

Time: ~2-3 hours total

** session-start
File: [[file:workflows/session-start.org][docs/workflows/session-start.org]]

Workflow for beginning a Claude Code session with proper context and priorities.

Triggered by: **Automatically at the start of EVERY session**

Workflow:
1. Add session start timestamp (check for interrupted sessions)
2. Sync with templates (exclude NOTES.org and previous-session-history.org)
3. Scan workflows directory for available workflows
4. Read key NOTES.org sections (NOT entire file)
5. Process inbox (mandatory)

Workflow for ending a Claude Code session cleanly with proper documentation and version control.

Triggered by: "wrap it up," "that's a wrap," "let's call it a wrap," or similar phrases

Workflow:
1. Write session notes to NOTES.org Session History section
2. Archive sessions older than 5 sessions to previous-session-history.org
3. Git commit and push all changes (NO Claude attribution)
4. Provide brief valediction with accomplishments and next steps

Ensures: Clean handoff between sessions, nothing lost, clear git history, proper documentation

**Example format:**
#+begin_example
** Feature Name or Topic

Craig needs to decide on [specific question].

Options:
1. Option A - [brief description, pros/cons]
2. Option B - [brief description, pros/cons]

Why this matters: [impact on project]

Implementation is ready - just need Craig's preference.
#+end_example

** Current Pending Decisions

(None currently - will be added as they arise)

* Active Reminders

** Current Reminders

(None currently - will be added as needed)

** Instructions for This Section

When Craig says "remind me" about something:
1. Add it here with timestamp and description
2. If it's a TODO, also add to =/home/cjennings/sync/org/roam/inbox.org= scheduled for today
3. Check this section at start of every session
4. Remove reminders once addressed

* Session History

This section contains notes from each session with Craig. Sessions are logged in reverse chronological order (most recent first).

**Note:** Sessions older than 5 sessions are archived in [[file:previous-session-history.org][Previous Session History]]

Each entry should use this format:

- **Timestamp:** =*** YYYY-MM-DD Day @ HH:MM TZ= (get TZ with =date +%z=)
- **Time estimate:** How long the session took

- **Files Modified:** Links to changed files (use relative paths)
- **Next Steps:** What to do next session (if applicable)

**Best practices:**
- Keep entries concise but informative
- Include enough context to resume work later
- Document important technical insights
- Note any new patterns or preferences discovered
- Link to files using org-mode =file:= links
