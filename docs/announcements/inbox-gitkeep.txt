The inbox/ directory was disappearing between sessions because git doesn't track
empty directories. A .gitkeep file has been added to fix this.

Action: If your project has an inbox/ directory, ensure it contains a .gitkeep file:

  touch inbox/.gitkeep

If your project doesn't have an inbox/ directory yet, create one with .gitkeep:

  mkdir -p inbox && touch inbox/.gitkeep
