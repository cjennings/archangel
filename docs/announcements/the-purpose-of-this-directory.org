The purpose of this directory is to contain one-off instructions for every project using these templates.

Example:
- restructing of the claude-specific directories. 
- announcements of new workflows and how to use them.
- one-off topics to be discussed with Craig when the templates are sync'd.

How The Directory Is Used
- Craig will decide that all projects will need to perform an action (reorganizing files, adding info to NOTES or protocols, removing unused workflows)
- Craig will add the instructions as a file in this directory
- When the project syncs templates, they will inherit new files in the directory
- They will discuss the instructions with Craig to ensure he knows they have understood the instructions and have the opportunity to ask any clarifying questions before executing the instructions.
- They will then execute the instructions.
- They will inform Craig of the results of executing the instructions (success, failure, and any observations). 
- Typically, they will delete the instructions when complete unless the instructions explicitly state to do otherwise.


NOTE: This file should always remain in the directory for future reference. This file may be overwritten by a template sync, but should never otherwise be deleted by claude.
