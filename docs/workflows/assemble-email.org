#+TITLE: Email Assembly Workflow
#+AUTHOR: Craig Jennings & Claude
#+DATE: 2026-01-29

* Overview

This workflow assembles documents for an email that will be sent via Craig's email client (Proton Mail). It creates a temporary workspace, gathers relevant documents, drafts the email, and cleans up after sending.

Use this workflow when Craig needs to send an email with multiple attachments that require gathering from various locations in the project.

* When to Use This Workflow

When Craig says:
- "assemble an email" or "email assembly workflow"
- "gather documents for an email"
- "I need to send [person] some documents"

* The Workflow

** Step 1: Create Temporary Workspace

Create a temporary folder at the project root:

#+begin_src bash
mkdir -p ./tmp
#+end_src

This folder will hold:
- Copies of all attachments
- The draft email text

** Step 2: Identify Required Documents

Discuss with Craig what documents are needed. Common categories:
- Legal documents (deeds, certificates, agreements)
- Financial documents (statements, invoices)
- Correspondence (prior emails, letters)
- Identity documents (death certificates, ID copies)

For each document:
1. Locate it in the project
2. Confirm with Craig it's the right one
3. Open it in zathura for Craig to verify if needed

** Step 3: Copy Documents to Workspace

**IMPORTANT: Always COPY, never MOVE documents.**

#+begin_src bash
cp /path/to/original/document.pdf ./tmp/
#+end_src

After copying, list the workspace contents to confirm:

#+begin_src bash
ls -lh ./tmp/
#+end_src

** Step 4: Draft the Email

Create a draft email file in the workspace:

#+begin_src bash
./tmp/email-draft.txt
#+end_src

Include:
- To: (recipient email)
- Subject: (clear, descriptive subject line)
- Body: (context, list of attachments, contact info)

The body should:
- Provide context for why documents are being sent
- List all attachments with brief descriptions
- Include Craig's contact information

** Step 5: Open Draft in Emacs

Open the draft for Craig to review and edit:

#+begin_src bash
emacsclient -n ./tmp/email-draft.txt
#+end_src

Wait for Craig to finish editing before proceeding.

** Step 6: Craig Sends Email

Craig will:
1. Open his email client (Proton Mail)
2. Create a new email using the draft text
3. Attach documents from the tmp folder
4. Send the email

** Step 7: Process Sent Email

Once Craig confirms the email was sent:

1. Craig saves the sent email to the inbox
2. Use the extraction script to process it:

#+begin_src bash
python3 docs/scripts/extract_attachments.py "./inbox/[email-file].eml"
#+end_src

3. Read the extracted content to verify
4. Rename and refile the email appropriately:

#+begin_src bash
mv "./inbox/[email-file].eml" ./[appropriate-folder]/YYYY-MM-DD-email-to-[recipient]-[topic].eml
#+end_src

5. Delete any duplicate extracted attachments from inbox

** Step 8: Clean Up Workspace

Delete the temporary folder:

#+begin_src bash
rm -rf ./tmp/
#+end_src

* Best Practices

** Document Verification

Before copying documents:
- Open each one in zathura for Craig to verify
- Confirm it's the correct version
- Check that sensitive information is appropriate to send

** Email Draft Structure

A good email draft includes:

#+begin_example
To: recipient@example.com
Subject: [Clear Topic] - [Property/Case Reference]

Hi [Name],

[Opening - context for why you're sending this]

[Middle - explanation of what's attached and why]

Attached are the following documents:

1. [Document name] - [brief description]
2. [Document name] - [brief description]
3. [Document name] - [brief description]

[Closing - next steps, request for confirmation, offer to provide more]

Thank you,

** Filing Conventions

When refiling sent emails:
- Use format: YYYY-MM-DD-email-to-[recipient]-[topic].eml
- File in the most relevant project folder.
- Remove duplicate attachments extracted to inbox

* Example Usage

Craig: "I need to send Seabreeze the documents for the HOA refund"

Claude:
1. Creates ./tmp/ folder
2. Discusses needed documents (death certificate, closing docs, purchase agreement)
3. Locates and opens each document for verification
4. Copies verified documents to ./tmp/
5. Drafts email and opens in emacsclient
6. Craig edits, then sends via Proton Mail
7. Craig saves sent email to inbox
8. Claude extracts, reads, renames, and refiles email
9. Claude deletes ./tmp/ folder
