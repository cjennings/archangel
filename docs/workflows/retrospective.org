#+TITLE: Retrospective Workflow
#+DESCRIPTION: How to run a retrospective after major problem-solving sessions

* When to Run a Retrospective

Run after:
- Major debugging/troubleshooting sessions
- Complex multi-step implementations
- Any session where significant friction occurred
- Sessions lasting more than an hour with trial-and-error

* The Process

** 0. Context Hygiene

Before starting, write out the session context file and check with Craig whether we could compact the context. If the context window collapses, we may forget important details. Writing out the session context prevents this data loss. 

** 1. Trigger the Retrospective

Either party can say: "Let's do a retrospective" or "Retrospective time"

** 2. Answer These Questions (Both Parties)

*** What went well?
Identify patterns worth reinforcing. Be specific.

*** What didn't go well?
Identify friction points, mistakes, wasted time. No blame, just facts.

*** What behavioral changes should we make?
Focus on *how we work*, not technical facts.
- Good: "Confirm before rebooting"
- Not behavioral: "AMD needs firmware 20260110"

*** What would we do differently next time?
Specific scenarios and better approaches.

*** Any new principles to add?
Distill lessons into short, actionable principles for retrospective/PRINCIPLES.org.

** 3. Copy and Update retrospectives/PRINCIPLES.org

Copy the template retrospectives/PRINCIPLES.org. 

Using the copied template, add new behavioral principles learned. Keep them:
- Short and actionable
- Focused on behavior, not facts
- Easy to remember and apply

** 4. Create Retrospective Record

Save to =docs/retrospectives/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.org= with:
- Summary of what happened
- Answers to the questions above
- Link to detailed session doc if exists

** 5. Commit Changes

Commit PRINCIPLES.org updates and retrospective record.

* PRINCIPLES.org Structure

#+BEGIN_SRC org
,* How We Work Together
,** Principle Name
- Bullet points explaining the principle
- When it applies
- Why it matters

,* Checklists
,** Checklist Name
- [ ] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2
#+END_SRC

* Integration with Session Startup

Add to project's protocols.org or session startup:
- Check if PRINCIPLES.org was updated since last session
- Review any new principles before starting work

* Example Principles (Starters)

** Sync Before Action
- Confirm before destructive or irreversible actions
- State what you're about to do and wait for go-ahead

** Verify Assumptions
- When something "should work" but doesn't, question the assumption
- Test one variable at a time

** Clean Up After Yourself
- Reset temporary changes before finishing
- Verify system is in expected state
