Code review of archzfs project complete. Issues documented in todo.org.

** Completed This Session
- Merged zfsbootmenu branch to main (fast-forward, pushed to origin)
- ratio booted successfully with ZFSBootMenu
- Researched code review best practices (10+ web searches)
- Created docs/project-workflows/code-review.org
  - Core Checklist: ~27 items across pyramid levels
  - Deep Dives: Security, Performance, Concurrency, Error Handling, API Compatibility, Dependencies
- Conducted senior developer code review of entire archzfs codebase

** Code Review Findings Summary
*** Critical (Priority A)
- README.org has outdated GRUB references (now uses ZFSBootMenu)
- Missing LICENSE file (referenced but doesn't exist)
- custom/archsetup-zfs is a non-functional skeleton
- Initial password should be configurable, not hardcoded

*** Important (Priority B)
- Stale SESSION-CONTEXT.md should be deleted
- PLAN-zfsbootmenu-implementation.org should move to docs/
- Makefile lint target swallows errors
- Unclear directories need documentation or gitignore
- Empty docs/someday-maybe.org

*** Cleanup (Priority C)
- Inconsistent shebangs across scripts
- Inconsistent email addresses
- No .editorconfig for formatting
- Test scripts need documentation
