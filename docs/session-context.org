#+TITLE: Session Context - Active Session
#+DATE: 2026-01-23

* Session: Friday 2026-01-23 @ 14:08 CST (ongoing)

** Key Decisions This Session

*** Project Rename: archangel
- Decided to rename project from "archzfs" to "archangel"
- Script name will be just "archangel" (not install-archangel)
- Checked for conflicts: pwnerfly/Archangel is dead (2020, 0 stars, no license)
- Name is clear for use

** Work Completed

*** 1. Btrfs Implementation Planning
- Created docs/PLAN-archangel-btrfs.org with 6-phase implementation
- Expanded testing validation checks in research doc
- Decided: snapper for snapshots, GRUB for btrfs boot

*** 2. Phase 1.1: lib/ Structure (COMPLETE)
Created modular library structure:
- [X] custom/lib/common.sh - output, validation, fzf prompts
- [X] custom/lib/config.sh - argument parsing, config loading
- [X] custom/lib/disk.sh - partitioning, disk selection
- [X] custom/lib/zfs.sh - ZFS pool, datasets, services

*** 3. Bug Fix: set -e compatibility
Found and fixed critical bug during VM testing:
- [[ condition ]] && error pattern fails with set -e
- When condition is false, expression returns 1, triggering set -e exit
- Fixed by converting to if/then/fi pattern

*** 4. Build System
- Updated build.sh to copy lib/ directory to ISO
- Built and tested 15G ISO with lib files

** Commits This Session
- 94c2f15: Add archsetup --chroot task
- 49a8b2e: Add btrfs implementation plan
- d8eb81a: Expand testing validation checks
- 15ac415: Phase 1.1 - Create lib/ directory structure
- 498ab4d: Fix build.sh to include lib/ in ISO
- c74b1d7: Fix set -e compatibility in lib functions

** VM Testing Status
- Lib files present in ISO: CONFIRMED
- install-archzfs --help: WORKS
- Config loading: WORKS
- ZFS pool creation: WORKS
- Pacstrap: Starts but needs fresh VM (stale state issue)

** Next Steps
1. Need clean VM test with fresh disk state
2. Rebuild ISO with set -e fix
3. Continue debugging install completion
4. Complete Phase 1 refactoring

** Notes
- Craig on remote console: 30 lines tall, ~145 columns wide
- Craig stepped away ~17:23, working autonomously
