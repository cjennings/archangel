*Status:* COMPLETE (continued above)

*What We Completed:*
- Initialized git repository
- Created .gitignore (excludes work/, out/, profile/, zfs-packages/)
- Initial commit with all build scripts
- Added docs/ to git (decided to track publicly)
- Built fresh ISO (archzfs-claude-2026.01.17-x86_64.iso, 4.9G)
- Tested ISO in QEMU VM
- Documented project goals and design decisions in NOTES.org

*Key Decisions Made:*
- Use linux-lts + zfs-dkms from archzfs.com (DKMS ensures kernel compatibility)
- Less aggressive snapshot policy (TrueNAS handles long-term backups)
- All install questions upfront, then unattended installation
- Root account only (archsetup creates user post-reboot)
- 32px GRUB font for HiDPI displays
- WiFi config tested before install starts

*Files Modified:*
- [[file:../.gitignore][.gitignore]] - created
- [[file:../build.sh][build.sh]] - major rewrite
- [[file:../custom/install-archzfs][custom/install-archzfs]] - complete rewrite
- [[file:../scripts/test-vm.sh][scripts/test-vm.sh]] - added serial console
