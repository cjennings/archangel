** TODO [#A] Build AUR packages and include in ISO as local repository
Build AUR packages during ISO creation and include them in a local pacman repository.
This allows AUR software to work both in the live environment AND be installable to target systems.

*** Implementation Plan

**** 1. Create build infrastructure
Add to build.sh or separate script (build-aur.sh):
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
build_aur_packages() {
    local aur_packages=(downgrade yay sanoid informant rate-mirrors)
    local repo_dir="$PROJECT_DIR/aur-packages"
    local build_dir="/tmp/aur-build"

    mkdir -p "$repo_dir" "$build_dir"

    for pkg in "${aur_packages[@]}"; do
        info "Building AUR package: $pkg"
        git clone --depth 1 "https://aur.archlinux.org/${pkg}.git" "$build_dir/${pkg}"
        (cd "$build_dir/${pkg}" && makepkg -s --noconfirm --needed)
        cp "$build_dir/${pkg}"/*.pkg.tar.zst "$repo_dir/"
    done

    # Create/update repo database
    repo-add "$repo_dir/aur.db.tar.gz" "$repo_dir"/*.pkg.tar.zst
}
#+END_SRC

**** 2. Add local repo to ISO's pacman.conf
In profile/pacman.conf, add:
#+BEGIN_SRC ini
[aur]
SigLevel = Optional TrustAll
Server = file:///usr/share/aur-packages
#+END_SRC

**** 3. Copy repo into ISO
In build.sh, copy aur-packages/ to profile/airootfs/usr/share/aur-packages/

**** 4. Add packages to packages.x86_64
Once in local repo, packages can be listed normally and pacman will find them.

**** 5. Make available during installation
In install-archzfs, copy local repo to target or mount it:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# Copy AUR repo to target for installation
cp -r /usr/share/aur-packages /mnt/usr/share/
# Add repo to target's pacman.conf temporarily
#+END_SRC

*** AUR Packages to Include

**** Essential (Priority A)
| Package | Description | Why needed |
|---------+-------------+------------|
| downgrade | Roll back to previous package versions | Essential for recovery when updates break |
| yay | AUR helper | Users can install additional AUR packages |
| informant | Check Arch news before upgrading | Prevents breaking changes from surprises |
| arch-wiki-lite | Offline Arch Wiki with CLI reader | Documentation when network is down |

**** ZFS Management (Priority A)
| Package | Description | Why needed |
|---------+-------------+------------|
| sanoid | ZFS snapshot policy management | Automated snapshot creation/pruning |
| syncoid | ZFS replication tool (part of sanoid) | Backup to remote systems |
| zrepl | ZFS replication daemon | Alternative to sanoid for replication |

**** System Maintenance (Priority B)
| Package | Description | Why needed |
|---------+-------------+------------|
| rate-mirrors | Fast Arch mirror selection | Better than reflector for speed |
| paru | Alternative AUR helper (Rust) | Some prefer over yay |
| pacman-cleanup-hook | Auto-remove old package cache | Disk space management |
| arch-audit | CVE security monitoring | Check for vulnerable packages |

**** Recovery Tools (Priority B)
| Package | Description | Why needed |
|---------+-------------+------------|
| ventoy-bin | Create multiboot USB drives | Useful rescue tool |
| topgrade | Universal upgrade tool | Update everything at once |
| mkinitcpio-firmware | Suppress firmware warnings | Cleaner initramfs builds |

**** Nice to Have (Priority C)
| Package | Description | Why needed |
|---------+-------------+------------|
| zfs-auto-snapshot | Automatic ZFS snapshots | Simple cron-based snapshots |
| btop | Modern resource monitor | Better than htop |
| duf | Modern disk usage viewer | Better than df |
| dust | Modern du replacement | Intuitive disk usage |
| procs | Modern ps replacement | Better process viewer |

*** Considerations
- Build must run on Arch Linux (or in Arch container)
- Some AUR packages have dependencies that are also AUR - need to handle build order
- Package versions will be frozen at ISO build time
- Consider caching built packages to speed rebuilds
- May want to GPG sign the local repo for security

*** Size Estimate
Most AUR packages are small (<5MB each). Estimate ~50-100MB for full suite.
Significantly less than pre-cloning git repos.

** TODO [#A] Install Arch Wiki on ISO for offline package help
Include offline Arch Wiki on the ISO for package documentation and troubleshooting.
Invaluable for rescue scenarios when networking is broken - exactly when you need docs most.

*** Reader Options

**** Option 1: arch-wiki-lite (AUR) - Recommended
Purpose-built CLI reader for offline Arch Wiki.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
$ wiki-search zfs
$ wiki-search mkinitcpio
#+END_SRC
- Searches articles by keyword
- Displays content as plain text in terminal
- Add to our AUR package build list

**** Option 2: arch-wiki-docs (official) + text browser
- Package installs HTML to /usr/share/doc/arch-wiki/html/
- Use w3m, lynx, or elinks to browse
- Would need wrapper script for searching:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/bin/bash
# archwiki - search and display offline Arch Wiki
WIKI_DIR="/usr/share/doc/arch-wiki/html"
SEARCH="$1"
MATCHES=$(find "$WIKI_DIR" -iname "*${SEARCH}*" -type f)
if [[ -n "$MATCHES" ]]; then
    echo "$MATCHES" | fzf --preview 'w3m -dump {}' | xargs w3m
fi
#+END_SRC

*** Implementation
1. Add arch-wiki-lite to AUR package list (leverages existing AUR infrastructure)
2. Also install arch-wiki-docs for complete HTML version
3. Add w3m for HTML viewing as backup
4. Document in RESCUE-GUIDE.txt

*** Size
- arch-wiki-docs: ~500MB compressed
- arch-wiki-lite: ~200MB (text only, smaller)
- Could include both for ~600MB total

** DONE [#B] Add zfsrollback and zfssnapshot scripts to ISO
CLOSED: [2026-01-19 Sun]
Include dedicated ZFS snapshot management scripts in the archzfs ISO rather than archsetup.
These tools belong here since they're useful for rescue scenarios and post-install management.

*** Scripts to create

**** zfssnapshot
Create manual or automated snapshots with consistent naming:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/bin/bash
# zfssnapshot - Create ZFS snapshots with optional retention
# Usage: zfssnapshot <dataset> [label]
# Example: zfssnapshot zroot/ROOT/arch pre-upgrade

DATASET="$1"
LABEL="${2:-manual}"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S)
SNAPNAME="${DATASET}@${LABEL}_${TIMESTAMP}"

zfs snapshot "$SNAPNAME"
echo "Created snapshot: $SNAPNAME"
#+END_SRC

Features to consider:
- Recursive snapshots (-r flag)
- Pre-defined labels (pre-upgrade, daily, hourly)
- Integration with pacman hooks for automatic pre-upgrade snapshots
- Quiet mode for cron/systemd usage

**** zfsrollback
Interactive rollback with safety checks:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/bin/bash
# zfsrollback - Safely rollback to a previous ZFS snapshot
# Usage: zfsrollback [dataset]
# Without args, shows all snapshots and prompts for selection

# List snapshots with fzf for selection
SNAP=$(zfs list -t snapshot -o name,creation -s creation | \
       fzf --header "Select snapshot to rollback to")

# Confirm before destructive operation
echo "WARNING: This will destroy all data created after the snapshot"
read -p "Rollback to $SNAP? [y/N] " confirm
[[ "$confirm" == "y" ]] && zfs rollback -r "$SNAP"
#+END_SRC

Features to consider:
- Show snapshot diff (what will be lost)
- Create safety snapshot before rollback
- Boot environment awareness (warn if rolling back root)
- Clone instead of rollback option (preserve current state)

*** Implementation
1. Create scripts in custom/zfssnapshot and custom/zfsrollback
2. Add to build.sh to copy to /usr/local/bin/
3. Add file_permissions entries in profiledef.sh
4. Document in RESCUE-GUIDE.txt
5. Consider systemd timers for automated snapshots

*** Why in archzfs instead of archsetup
- Rescue scenarios: rollback from live USB when system won't boot
- Standalone utility: works on any ZFS system, not just archsetup installs
- ISO always available: no need to install archsetup first
- Simpler: self-contained scripts vs. dependency on archsetup

** TODO [#B] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated ISO builds
*** Options to evaluate
- Self-hosted on TrueNAS (primary target)
  - Gitea + Gitea Actions or Drone CI
  - Jenkins in a jail/VM
  - Woodpecker CI (lightweight Drone fork)
- GitHub Actions (if repo mirrored to GitHub)
- GitLab CI (self-hosted or gitlab.com)

*** Requirements
- Arch Linux build environment (container or VM)
- Sudo/root access for mkarchiso
- ~10GB disk space per build
- Caching for pacman packages to speed builds

*** Considerations
- Trigger builds on push to main
- Scheduled builds (weekly?) to catch upstream updates
- Store artifacts (ISO) with retention policy
- Notifications on build failure
- Test automation (boot ISO in QEMU, run checks)

*** TrueNAS-specific tips
- Use a jail or VM for the CI runner
- Consider bhyve VM with Arch Linux for native builds
- Mount dataset for build artifacts and cache
- Snapshot before/after builds for easy cleanup

** TODO [#C] Consider Avahi for USB boot disk discoverability
Make the live ISO discoverable on the network by name (e.g., archzfs.local) when booted.
This would make SSH access easier without needing to find the IP address.

Already have avahi package installed - just need to configure/enable it.

Note: Nice to have but not critical. IP can be found via router or console.

** TODO [#C] Consider adding bootable archzfs ISO to GRUB boot menu
Store the archzfs ISO on disk and add a GRUB menu entry to boot it directly - no USB drive needed for recovery/reinstall.

*** Benefits
- Always have a rescue environment available
- Can reinstall or rollback without external media
- Useful for remote/headless servers

*** Challenges
1. Storage location - ISO is 5GB. Can't live on ZFS (GRUB can't read it). Options:
   - EFI partition (currently 1GB - would need to be larger)
   - Dedicated recovery partition (ext4 or FAT32)
   - Second EFI partition just for the ISO

2. GRUB loopback boot - Arch ISOs support this with the right kernel params:
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   menuentry "Archzfs Recovery" {
       loopback loop /path/to/archzfs.iso
       linux (loop)/arch/boot/x86_64/vmlinuz-linux archisolabel=ARCHZFS
       initrd (loop)/arch/boot/x86_64/initramfs-linux.img
   }
   #+END_SRC

3. Keeping it updated - Would need a mechanism to update the ISO when rebuilding

*** Questions to resolve
- Is this for recovery scenarios, or would you actually reinstall from it?
- Would you want this integrated into the installer (auto-create recovery partition)?
- Or just document how to set it up manually?

** TODO [#C] Research mkosi as alternative to mkarchiso
Investigate whether mkosi (systemd project) offers advantages over mkarchiso.

*** Comparison
| Aspect | mkarchiso | mkosi |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Purpose | Live ISO images | Disk images, containers, ISOs |
| Config | Shell scripts + file structure | Declarative TOML files |
| Output | ISO9660 (USB/CD) | GPT disk images, tarballs, ISOs |
| Boot | GRUB/syslinux/systemd-boot | UKI (Unified Kernel Images) |
| Distros | Arch only | Arch, Fedora, Debian, Ubuntu |
| Build env | Host or chroot | Container-native, reproducible |

*** Where mkosi shines
- Reproducible builds - designed for CI/CD, hermetic builds
- Unified Kernel Images - modern secure boot (kernel+initrd+cmdline in one signed EFI)
- VM images - can output raw disk images directly (great for QEMU testing)
- Declarative - TOML config instead of shell scripts

*** Where mkarchiso is better for us
- Arch ecosystem - all docs, examples, community use it
- ZFS live environment - archiso has the hooks we need
- Proven - we know it works for our use case

*** Verdict
Keep mkarchiso for now. mkosi could be valuable for:
- VM test images instead of booting ISOs
- Future UKI boot (more secure boot chain)
- Reproducibility when CI/CD becomes important

GitHub: https://github.com/stevleibelt/arch-linux-live-cd-iso-with-zfs

*** TODO [#A] Integrate ZFSBootMenu as alternative boot manager
ZFSBootMenu is a powerful boot manager specifically designed for ZFS root systems.
It provides boot environment selection, snapshot rollback from boot menu, and recovery options.

Benefits:
- Boot directly into any ZFS snapshot
- Rollback to previous boot environment without booting first
- Better ZFS-native boot experience than GRUB
- Single EFI file (~15MB) that can be updated independently

Implementation:
- Download portable EFI from https://get.zfsbootmenu.org/efi
- Include in ISO's /root/software/zfsbootmenu/
- Add update script for post-installation updates
- Consider as GRUB alternative or supplement

Reference: https://zfsbootmenu.org/

*** TODO [#B] Add Docker/Podman container support for builds
The reference project uses containers with minimal capabilities instead of full root/privileged mode.
This improves security and reproducibility.

Capabilities needed for mkarchiso:
- DAC_OVERRIDE
- SYS_ADMIN
- SYS_CHROOT
- SYS_MODULE
- Device: /dev/loop-control

Benefits:
- Reproducible builds across different host systems
- No need to install archiso on host
- Cleaner build environment
- Easier CI/CD integration

*** TODO [#B] Support building against Arch Linux Archive snapshots
When archzfs lags behind the main Arch repos, builds can fail due to kernel version mismatch.
The reference project supports pinning to historical repo snapshots.

Implementation:
- Add -r/--repo-date flag to build.sh
- Use archive.archlinux.org for historical packages
- Example: ./build.sh -r 2026/01/15 or ./build.sh -r week

This solves the common problem of ZFS packages not being available for the latest kernel.

*** TODO [#C] Add build logging with tee
Capture all build output to a log file for debugging and CI artifact collection.

Implementation:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
exec &> >(tee "build-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).log")
#+END_SRC

Also useful: Check log for known error patterns (e.g., DKMS failures) and fail fast.

Note: Simple to implement but low urgency.

*** TODO [#C] Support multi-variant ISO builds
The reference project builds 8 variants automatically:
- linux vs linux-lts kernel
- DKMS vs native ZFS packages
- Default vs experimental archzfs repos

Could be useful for offering users choice between stability and bleeding-edge.
Lower priority since we currently focus on linux-lts + DKMS for maximum compatibility.

*** TODO [#C] Pre-clone useful tools and documentation into ISO
The reference project bundles Git repos (without .git dirs) into /root:
- archinstall (official installer)
- downgrade (package rollback)
- ZFS howtos and documentation
- Recovery scripts

Already partially implemented (have rescue tools), but could expand with:
- Pre-cloned arch-linux-configuration scripts
- ZFS administration cheatsheets
- Offline troubleshooting guides

*** TODO [#C] Add environment file configuration (.env pattern)
Allow build customization via .env file instead of command-line flags.
Useful for CI/CD and reproducible builds.

Example .env:
#+BEGIN_SRC
KERNEL=linux-lts
USE_DKMS=1
BE_VERBOSE=0
PACKAGES_TO_ADD=git,vim
PACKAGES_TO_REMOVE=b43-fwcutter
#+END_SRC

*** TODO [#C] Add dry-run mode to build.sh
Support --dry-run flag that shows what would be done without executing.
Useful for testing configuration changes and debugging.

*** Size Estimate
- Core recovery tools (no ClamAV/Wireshark): ~90MB
- With ClamAV: +150MB
- With Wireshark CLI: +50MB
- GUI tools (optional): ~20MB
- Total estimate: ~150-300MB additional
- Current ISO size: 5.1GB
- Projected size with all tools: ~5.4GB

*** Discussion Notes
- SystemRescue is also Arch-based, making it a good reference for package names
- Hiren's BootCD PE is now Windows-based, but older Linux version had good tool selection
- Most recovery scenarios need: testdisk, ddrescue, chntpw, smartmontools, ntfs-3g
- For Windows malware scanning, ClamAV is the standard open-source option
- Consider: could offer two ISO variants (minimal vs full rescue)

*** Questions to Resolve
- Include ClamAV? Adds ~150MB but very useful for Windows malware scanning
- Include Wireshark CLI (tshark)? Adds ~50MB for network forensics
- Keep ISO under specific size target (e.g., 6GB for single-layer DVD)?
- Add GUI tools or keep it minimal/CLI-focused?
- Create separate "rescue" build profile or add to main ISO?
- Priority order for implementation?
