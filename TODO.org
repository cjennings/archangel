* Open Work
** TODO [#B] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated ISO builds
*** Options to evaluate
- Self-hosted on TrueNAS (primary target)
  - Gitea + Gitea Actions or Drone CI
  - Jenkins in a jail/VM
  - Woodpecker CI (lightweight Drone fork)
- GitHub Actions (if repo mirrored to GitHub)
- GitLab CI (self-hosted or gitlab.com)

*** Requirements
- Arch Linux build environment (container or VM)
- Sudo/root access for mkarchiso
- ~10GB disk space per build
- Caching for pacman packages to speed builds

*** Considerations
- Trigger builds on push to main
- Scheduled builds (weekly?) to catch upstream updates
- Store artifacts (ISO) with retention policy
- Notifications on build failure
- Test automation (boot ISO in QEMU, run checks)

*** TrueNAS-specific tips
- Use a jail or VM for the CI runner
- Consider bhyve VM with Arch Linux for native builds
- Mount dataset for build artifacts and cache
- Snapshot before/after builds for easy cleanup

** TODO [#C] Check for methods to abstract

* Resolved
** DONE [#B] Add config file information to README
Config file format documented in README.org with full reference and examples.

** DONE [#B] Add CI/CD test infrastructure
Added Makefile, test-install.sh, and test configs for automated VM testing.

** CANCELLED [#C] Consider Dialog-Based Interface for Status, Information, and Questions
Using fzf instead.

** DONE [#C] Consider fzf interface for choices
Implemented fzf for timezone, locale, keymap, disk, RAID, and WiFi selection.
** DONE [#A] Create comprehensive project documentation (README.org)
