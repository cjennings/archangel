* Open Work
** TODO [#A] Add downgrade package to ISO
The downgrade utility allows rolling back to previous package versions from the Arch Linux Archive.
Essential for recovery scenarios when an update breaks something.

Package is AUR-only, so needs pre-building or AUR helper integration in build process.
- Option 1: Pre-build with yay/paru and add to zfs-packages/
- Option 2: Add AUR repo to pacman.conf in build

** TODO [#B] Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated ISO builds
*** Options to evaluate
- Self-hosted on TrueNAS (primary target)
  - Gitea + Gitea Actions or Drone CI
  - Jenkins in a jail/VM
  - Woodpecker CI (lightweight Drone fork)
- GitHub Actions (if repo mirrored to GitHub)
- GitLab CI (self-hosted or gitlab.com)

*** Requirements
- Arch Linux build environment (container or VM)
- Sudo/root access for mkarchiso
- ~10GB disk space per build
- Caching for pacman packages to speed builds

*** Considerations
- Trigger builds on push to main
- Scheduled builds (weekly?) to catch upstream updates
- Store artifacts (ISO) with retention policy
- Notifications on build failure
- Test automation (boot ISO in QEMU, run checks)

*** TrueNAS-specific tips
- Use a jail or VM for the CI runner
- Consider bhyve VM with Arch Linux for native builds
- Mount dataset for build artifacts and cache
- Snapshot before/after builds for easy cleanup

** TODO [#B] Consider Avahi for USB boot disk discoverability
Make the live ISO discoverable on the network by name (e.g., archzfs.local) when booted.
This would make SSH access easier without needing to find the IP address.

Already have avahi package installed - just need to configure/enable it.

** TODO [#B] Consider adding bootable archzfs ISO to GRUB boot menu
Store the archzfs ISO on disk and add a GRUB menu entry to boot it directly - no USB drive needed for recovery/reinstall.

*** Benefits
- Always have a rescue environment available
- Can reinstall or rollback without external media
- Useful for remote/headless servers

*** Challenges
1. Storage location - ISO is 5GB. Can't live on ZFS (GRUB can't read it). Options:
   - EFI partition (currently 1GB - would need to be larger)
   - Dedicated recovery partition (ext4 or FAT32)
   - Second EFI partition just for the ISO

2. GRUB loopback boot - Arch ISOs support this with the right kernel params:
   #+BEGIN_SRC
   menuentry "Archzfs Recovery" {
       loopback loop /path/to/archzfs.iso
       linux (loop)/arch/boot/x86_64/vmlinuz-linux archisolabel=ARCHZFS
       initrd (loop)/arch/boot/x86_64/initramfs-linux.img
   }
   #+END_SRC

3. Keeping it updated - Would need a mechanism to update the ISO when rebuilding

*** Questions to resolve
- Is this for recovery scenarios, or would you actually reinstall from it?
- Would you want this integrated into the installer (auto-create recovery partition)?
- Or just document how to set it up manually?

** TODO [#C] Check for methods to abstract

* Resolved
** DONE [#B] Add config file information to README
Config file format documented in README.org with full reference and examples.

** DONE [#B] Add CI/CD test infrastructure
Added Makefile, test-install.sh, and test configs for automated VM testing.

** CANCELLED [#C] Consider Dialog-Based Interface for Status, Information, and Questions
Using fzf instead.

** DONE [#C] Consider fzf interface for choices
Implemented fzf for timezone, locale, keymap, disk, RAID, and WiFi selection.
** DONE [#A] Create comprehensive project documentation (README.org)

*** Size Estimate
- Core recovery tools (no ClamAV/Wireshark): ~90MB
- With ClamAV: +150MB
- With Wireshark CLI: +50MB
- GUI tools (optional): ~20MB
- Total estimate: ~150-300MB additional
- Current ISO size: 5.1GB
- Projected size with all tools: ~5.4GB

*** Discussion Notes
- SystemRescue is also Arch-based, making it a good reference for package names
- Hiren's BootCD PE is now Windows-based, but older Linux version had good tool selection
- Most recovery scenarios need: testdisk, ddrescue, chntpw, smartmontools, ntfs-3g
- For Windows malware scanning, ClamAV is the standard open-source option
- Consider: could offer two ISO variants (minimal vs full rescue)

*** Questions to Resolve
- Include ClamAV? Adds ~150MB but very useful for Windows malware scanning
- Include Wireshark CLI (tshark)? Adds ~50MB for network forensics
- Keep ISO under specific size target (e.g., 6GB for single-layer DVD)?
- Add GUI tools or keep it minimal/CLI-focused?
- Create separate "rescue" build profile or add to main ISO?
- Priority order for implementation?
